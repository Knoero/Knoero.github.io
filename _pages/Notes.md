## Machine Learning Notes

<i>The way I have all the things related to machine learning formed and organized in my mind.</i>

### Reference materials

The study notes are taken from multiple sources, including course notes in Purdue and two free books introducing deep learning.

- Course notes of *ECE 570: Artificial Intelligence* by *Prof. David I. Inouye*, Purdue
- Course notes of *ME 539: Introduction to scientific computing* by *Prof. Ilias Bilionis*, Purdue
- Course notes of *ECE/BME 695: Deep Learning* by *Prof. Avi Kak* and *Prof. Charles Bouman*, Purdue
- Course notes of *MA 527: Advanced Mathematics for Engineers and Physicists I* by *Prof. Birgit Kaufmann*, Purdue
- [Dive Into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preface/index.html)
- [MIT Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

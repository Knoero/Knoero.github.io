## Machine Learning Notes

### Description

- Personal study notes taken in my study
- Collect the concepts, algorithms and models in machine learning and deep learning
- Try to build a systematic knowledge ranging from basic mathematics to application of common models
- Serve as a knowledge base and a code base for future study
- Not finished yet, but updated frequently with my fragmented time. The current structure **only contains what I've learned and coded**.
- Any corrections or advice would be greatly appreciated.

### Reference materials

The study notes are taken from multiple sources, including course notes in Purdue and two free books introducing deep learning.

- Course notes of *ECE 570: Artificial Intelligence* by *Prof. David I. Inouye*, Purdue
- Course notes of *ME 539: Introduction to scientific computing* by *Prof. Ilias Bilionis*, Purdue
- Course notes of *ECE/BME 695: Deep Learning* by *Prof. Avi Kak* and *Prof. Charles Bouman*, Purdue
- Course notes of *MA 527: Advanced Mathematics for Engineers and Physicists I* by *Prof. Birgit Kaufmann*, Purdue

## Other Notes

### Description

- Some simple notes I've taken for a quick reference. 
- I would like to also make a comprehensive note of all the controlling-related concepts I've learned in so many courses and experiments. However, I'd better finish the Machine Learning notes first since I cannot spare any other time for these notes these days.

### Table of Contents

- **[ROS Quick Review Notes](https://knoero.github.io/files/Others/00%20ROS%20Quick%20Review%20Notes.pdf)**
  - Simple notes about ROS concepts and usage for a quick reference.

## Description

Here is a list of research works I've participated in during my undergraduate graduate study and graduate study.

## 3D Through-wall Imaging With Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using WIFI

- **Project Type**: Undergraduate research program of Mechanical Engineering in SJTU.

- **Goal**: Trying to verify and reproduce the result of [a research paper from IEEE]([3D through-wall imaging with unmanned aerial vehicles using wifi | Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3055031.3055084)).

- **Supervisor**: *[Prof. Weiwei Cai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4mYjOrsAAAAJ&hl=en)*, Associate professor in Institute of Turbomachinery of SJTU.

- **Main Tools**: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, Arduino, Python.

- **Responsibility**: 

  - Buying components and build two simplest UAV.
  - Create simple modes of motion and tune the parameters so that the distance for each move step is fixed.
  - Organize the flight path and control the  two UAV flying through the desired path at the same time while sampling the WIFI signal strength automatically.
  - Help using the signal strength data to rebuild 3D model.

Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a master student in Mechanical Engineering  at **Purdue University in West Lafayette** and I'm expected to graduate this semester (Fall 2021). I obtained the Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2020 from **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, Shanghai, China. I attended Purdue University as an international exchange student in my senior year and started my graduate study in Fall 2020. 

Even though the COVID pandemic caused me to take all of my classes online in the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters, preventing me from transferring to the thesis track, I have gained valuable research experience and a strong foundation in my major field. On the one hand, I actively joined a number of different control and optimization research projects. On the other hand, I took advantage of the course selection flexibility and registered for courses in machine learning methods, adaptive control theories, and robotic dynamics that were highly relevant to my interests. In the meanwhile, since I've become familiar with the theories and algorithms, I've been making my own study notes for all of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning knowledge I've gained. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm continuing to work on it in my spare time.

My current research interests are **learning for control systems** and its **application in robotics**. More specifically, I would like to devote myself to the fascinating interface between control, optimization, and machine learning. One existing work in this direction, for example, is to use deep neural networks to model the significant non-linearities when controlling a quadcopter with model reference adaptive control (MRAC) based controllers, resulting a faster convergence of parameter estimations under the same excitation condition.

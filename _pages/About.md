Welcome to my personal website!

I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at [Purdue University in West Lafayette](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by [Prof. Andrea Vacca](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/PhotoGallery/Event01/People/People/ptProfile?resource_id=61666&group_id=11989). Development and application of advanced control and optimization algorithms are my main research interests. As a graduate research assistant in [Maha Fluid Power Research Center](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Maha/), I'm working on the development and validation of energy-efficient control systems for heavy hydraulic machines.

Before joining Maha, I did an intern at [PinOn, Inc](https://pinon.io/) as an algorithm engineer. Prior to that, in Fall 2021, I obtained my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University. In 2020, I graduated from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering after being an exchanged student at Purdue in my senior year.

I've been enjoying organizing my study notes for all the knowledge I would frequently use, which is a useful and pleasing way for me to back my research objectives up. I would like to share the notes I organized from a learner's view because I believe I can always be inspired by others' different opinions.

For more information, please refer to my latest [CV](https://knoero.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

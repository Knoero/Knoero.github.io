Welcome to my personal website!

I'm currently an intern at [PinOn, Inc](https://pinon.io/) as a CV algorithm engineer. Prior to that, in Fall 2021, I completed my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at [Purdue University in West Lafayette](https://www.purdue.edu/). In 2020, I graduated from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. In my senior year, I was an international exchange student at Purdue University, and I began my graduate studies in Fall 2020. 

In my major field, I've received valuable research experience and built a solid foundation. On the one hand, I was an active participant in a variety of control and optimization research initiatives. On the other hand, I took advantage of the course selection flexibility and enrolled in courses that were highly relevant to my interests, such as machine learning methods, adaptive control theories, and robotic dynamics.  

I've been compiling my own study notes for all of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning knowledge I've gathered since becoming familiar with the theories and algorithms. I haven't finished it, but I'll keep working on it in my spare time.

The fascinating and promising intersection between control, optimization, and machine learning is one of my main research interests. For more detailed information, please refer to my latest [CV](https://knoero.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

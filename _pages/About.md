Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a master student in Mechanical Engineering  at [Purdue University in West Lafayette]() and I'm expected to graduate this semester (Fall 2021). I obtained the Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2020 from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China. I attended Purdue University as an international exchange student in my senior year and started my graduate study in Fall 2020. 

Although the covid pandemic forced me to take fully-online courses in the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, and prevented me from transferring into the thesis track , I have equipped myself with rich research experiences and built a solid foundation in my major field. On the one hand, I've worked on several different research programs related to control and optimization. On the other hand, I intentionally registered for courses related to machine learning algorithms, adaptive control theories and robotic dynamics due to interests.  I've been making my own study notes for all the Machine Learning and Deep Learning knowledge I've learned since I've been quite familiar with the theories and algorithms. I haven't finished it yet but I'm keeping updating it using my fragmented time.

My current research interests are learning systems for control and robotics. More specifically, I would like to try to apply the machine learning techniques to control problems with stability guarantee such that even non-linear systems could get optimized efficiently with long-term learning properties.  One example is to use deep neural networks to  model significant non-linearities in model reference adaptive control (MRAC) based controllers, which is supposed to fasten the convergence of parameter estimations.
